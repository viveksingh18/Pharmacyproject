# Pharmacyproject
This Online Pharmacy Project is aimed to develop a systematic way to keep track of the medicine supplies by the distributors as well as make orders and modify them as a customer. Users of the system include Admin, distributor and customer. The admin after successfully logging in would be able to visit the customerâ€™s profile and see the details, delete customers, create new customer profile, browse through the ordered medicine details and also delete or update placed orders. As a distributor, when logged in, you can browse through all the orders and select the particular orders to be distributed. After logging in as a customer, you can place order and keep track of it by contacting the distributor.
